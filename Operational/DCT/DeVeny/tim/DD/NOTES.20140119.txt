DUALDD LMI DSP NOTES

1. To prevent trouble, references to VABG were commented out.

2. Although it is said PWR is not used (pre-amp power) it is present in the
   DAC table so PWR_I, PWR_T and PWR_D levels (all 6.0) are defined.

3. There's a comment in the code regarding VOD
   "VOD is 1 V lower than specified because of IR drops in the lopass filters"
   Does this have any bearing on our adopted T and I levels?

4. Values for VOD_MAX, VOG_MAX ad VRD_MAX constant throughout since they
   appear to be just scaling.

5. There are gain and integrator values in the DAC table- do these vary?

6. Do the video offsets vary?

7. The SBV command was again made a no-op

8. DAC_GNSPD- this is mapped into the DD levels only for setting gain 
   and speed.
