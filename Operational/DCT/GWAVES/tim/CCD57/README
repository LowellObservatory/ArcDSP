Waveforms Notes for ARC47R1E board				2/21/18 EWD

There are two IMO waveforms files here, 

GWAVES.waveforms.IMO.crossed.s 
  The polarity bit for the dual slope integrator hasn't been reversed to
  reflect the new scheme where Pol+ and Pol- are replaced with Pol and an
  unused bit (bit 2).  This works if you are using differential inputs and
  cross the inputs with jumpers.  These can be wires if you don't need to
  reduce the input voltage swings or series resistors if you want to make
  a voltage divider with the 1K resistor to ground.  The jumpers go from
  J3-2 to J5-1 and J5-2 to J3-1 for the first channel.  A similar arrangement
  happens wth J8 & J10 for the second channel.

  This is what we did for the CCD67 GWAVES probes.

GWAVES.waveforms.IMO.straight.s
  Here the usual jumper arrangements can be made on the video board and the
  sense of the polarity bit is changed.  It follows the lead of the LMI 
  waveforms file.  This is required if you aren't using the differential
  input capability of the video board.  It is an alternative approach if you
  are using the differential inputs - no "custom" crossed jumpers needed,
  but if you need a voltage divider you're stuck with some hardware work
  anyway.

GWAVES.waveforms.IMO.s is a link to one or the other of these.
