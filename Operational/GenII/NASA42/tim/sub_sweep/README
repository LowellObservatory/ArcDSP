These lod files are for varying effective substrate voltages.  

Can't get DD right except for the 9V case since I picked a bias that can 
only go to 20V.  It should go up to 29V for the zero substrate case.

Can't quite do the zero volt case properly due to limitations on clock
and bias voltages.

See notes from 1/14/10, 4/9/10, and 4/11/10 for preparation for this test.
