This is the version last on nasa42 from plcdsp called v1.7_7_5x.

This will be modified for gen-iii ccd boards and will be used with gwaves.

This is used by both HIPO and NASA42 and is called pci.loxx on these machines.

Note that NASAcam doesn't appear to have a special PCI DSP.  It looks like 
it uses the generic code from Bob.
